# Customer Churn Analytics — Technical Report

This document summarizes the **methodology, pipeline, and insights** for the Telco Customer Churn analytics dashboard (SQL → R → Tableau).

---

## 1. Objective

- Identify **churn patterns** and **high-risk customer segments** for a subscription-based telecom service.
- Quantify **revenue at risk** and support retention actions via an executive-facing Tableau dashboard.
- Use the public **Telco Customer Churn** dataset as a case study.

---

## 2. Pipeline Overview

| Stage   | Tool     | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Ingest | SQL      | Create tables, clean staging, build KPI views |
| Transform | R     | Extract from DB, build KPI tables, churn drivers |
| Visualize | Tableau | Dashboard: churn rate, segments, revenue at risk |

## 3. Data

- **Source:** [Kaggle – Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) (e.g. export as `telco-churn.csv`).
- **Raw data** is stored in `data/raw/` and **is tracked in Git** for reproducibility and GitHub Pages.
- **Processed CSVs** for Tableau live in `data/processed/` (generated by R scripts).

---

## 4. Key Metrics

- **Churn rate** — % of customers who churned in the observation window.
- **MRR at risk** — Monthly recurring revenue from churned (or at-risk) customers.
- **Segment-level KPIs** — Churn rate and revenue at risk by contract type, tenure, and other dimensions.

---

## 5. Dashboard

The Tableau workbook connects to the CSVs in `data/processed/` and presents:

- Overall churn rate and trend.
- High-risk segments (e.g. month-to-month, low tenure).
- Revenue at risk and driver breakdowns.


---

## 6. Reproducibility

1. Place raw Telco CSV in `data/raw/`.
2. Run SQL scripts in order: `01_create_tables.sql` → `02_clean_staging.sql` → `03_kpi_views.sql`.
3. In R, install dependencies via `source("r/requirements.R")`, then run `01_extract_from_sql.R` → `02_kpi_tables.R` → `03_churn_drivers.R`.
4. Point Tableau to `data/processed/` and refresh the dashboard.
